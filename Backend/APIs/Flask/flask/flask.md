## What is Flask
Python being a very popular language used in many fields including web development, it is also used in many other fields.
[Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.2.x/) is a micro framework that is used to create web applications. It
depends on the [Jinja2](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/2.10.x/) template engine to render templates and 
[Werkzeug](https://werkzeug.palletsprojects.com/en/1.0.x/) to handle requests making it light and a prominent framework 
for building fast and light APIs.

## Installing Flask

[pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) command to install Flask.
